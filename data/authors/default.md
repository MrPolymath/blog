Hi! My name is Daniel Carmona.

I'm an Aerospace Engineer, but I've never worked in the aerospace sector (yet). Instead, I've been bootstraping businesses since the first year of college (and also did some consulting for a private company in the USA).

This blog starts from the beginning, and the purpose is to share my experiences of building companies from scratch. Over the last 9 years I've learned a lot about things like idea generation, leadership, funding, techonology... And I want to share it all.

Lastly, I'll esporadically talk about the future, in the form of ideas that I might start working on soon or that I'd like other to work on.

I hope you enjoy this!
