    title: '3D Printer',
    description: `I built a 3D printer from scratch. It was based on an Open Source from RepRap. 
    This was the first big tech project that I did. This was before 3D printing became mainstream.`,

    description: `Volumetrick was a SaaS for adding automatic quoting of 3D files that need to be printed.
    It allowed printing shops and FabLabs to personalize a formula, based on multiple parameters, that outputs the price
    they should charge to their clients`,

    title: 'Instatargeting',
    description: `This was a tool that helped businesses grow their instagram accounts with followers of real interest (possible clients).
    The idea was that intagram bots in the market were only aiming at growing the number of followers, 
    but weren't deciding who was a good fit to target. We asked clients to provide us with instagram accounts that had a similar target, 
    and used that as our source to find other people to interact with.`,

    title: 'Tu bot vendedor',
    description: `Back when messenger bots (facebook) seemed to be the next big thing (2015), 
    we built a bot that allowed you to publish items for sale in multiple spanish websites, 
    just by telling the bot the title of the article, a description, and sending it some images.
    The interaction was flawless and, for many months, we were in the top 5 results when you searched
    for a bot on Facebook.`,

    title: 'Social network Photo Printer',
    description: `This was a 3D printer connected to a Raspberry Pi, encased in a box, 
    that was configured to listen at specific hashtags or tags in social media. If an image with that specific hashtag or tag was published, 
    the printer would print the image. This was used by restaurants to have clients engage with their social media accounts.
    You could get your printed image in the restaurant with your friends in a format similar to a Polaroid, in exchange of adding a
    hashtag or tagging the restaurant, which helped them grow their business.
    Also, the print could be slightly customized by the business, to add their logo.`,

    title: 'Clone of 2good2go, but in Spain',
    description: `2good2go is a service that allows people to buy the food that restaurants and bakeries are going
    to throw at the end of the day, at a very reduced price.
    Back then, 2good2go was just a hot startup in the UK, and we thought it was a good idea.
    We talked to a bunch of restaurants and bakeries, and they were interested.
    We decided not to build it'`,
